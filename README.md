[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This study aimed to design a mobile application that supports a healthy eating approach for individuals. Firebase Authentication was used for user login and registration. By obtaining user data (height, weight), the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, and the Classification method from Machine Learning techniques was employed to classify users into categories such as "Underweight - Ideal Weight - Overweight - Obese - Morbidly Obese." Based on the user's classification, the application provides different diet plans to meet their specific needs. This user-friendly app facilitates diet tracking and also displays the balance of nutrients and calories by retrieving data from the internet. It offers information about various diets such as the Mediterranean Diet, Vegan Diet, and Atkins Diet, aiming to raise user awareness. Additionally, the app features an interface that enables users to track their progress towards their target weight by indicating how many kilograms they have left to reach their goal. The calendar page allows users to select their preferred time frame for following the diet, thus facilitating diet tracking. This is an Android-based mobile application developed using Kotlin as the primary programming language within Android Studio.
